I've just deployed my website. I'll be using this space to add dev notes and just dump everything on my head. Maybe we will teach each other something.

## What this is

This is a dev blog — a place to document the things I'm building, breaking, and figuring out. Expect posts about:

- **PSX-style game development** with Godot and Blender
- **Creative tooling** and developer experience
- **Web tech** — the stack behind this site and other projects
- **Music production** and sound design
- **AI tools** — making them actually useful

## The stack

This site is built with **Next.js 16**, styled with inline CSS (yes, really), and uses an MDX pipeline for blog posts. The aesthetic is inspired by PlayStation 1 era UIs and Metal Gear Solid codec screens.

```typescript
// the theme system is just two big objects
const THEMES = {
  light: { bg: "#fff", text: "#000", mgsText: "#88cc88" },
  dark: { bg: "#1a1a1a", text: "#fff", mgsText: "#88cc88" },
};
```

The dither patterns are generated as inline SVGs — no image files needed. Everything renders server-side where possible, with client components only for interactivity.

## What's next

More posts. More projects. More chaos.

Stay tuned.
